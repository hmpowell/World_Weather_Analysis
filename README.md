# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this assignment was to create maps using the Google Maps API to help plan a trip for a travel agency. We used a random city generator to choose cities and then chose cities based on the high temperatures, taken in December 2021. We then chose 4 cities to plan a trip, visiting each of the four cities in turn.

Though I had problems loading the gmaps dependency, I was able to get help to load it into my computer and was able to complete the challenge.
